TODOs
===========================

There are still a lot of things to get done:
* Tie in Flask and PostgreSQL for storing site-level data (name, URL, favicon colors, site colors, categories, etc.)
* Figure out how to properly utilize Python's logging
* Update front end to allow for exploring website categories, seeing color histograms, and whatnot. Still undecided on final UI
